> 📚 *This is a guided project completed as part of the [Codebasics Data Analytics Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhZ62IlTxYs&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uva8pk1FI3iK9kCOKQdz1I9).*  
> The business case, dataset, and overall structure were provided by Codebasics. This repository documents my independent implementation, learning, and presentation of the project using **MySQL** and **Power BI**.


## 📌 Project Overview

This case study simulates a real-world scenario where **Atliq Hardware**, a fast-growing computer hardware company in India, struggles with fragmented and unreliable sales reporting.
