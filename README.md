# 💼 Atliq Hardware Sales Insights Project 

> 📚 *This is a guided project completed as part of the [Codebasics Data Analytics Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhZ62IlTxYs&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uva8pk1FI3iK9kCOKQdz1I9).*  
> The business case, dataset, and overall structure were provided by Codebasics. This repository documents my independent implementation, learning, and presentation of the project using **MySQL** and **Power BI**.


## 📌 Project Overview

This case study simulates a real-world scenario where **Atliq Hardware**, a fast-growing computer hardware company in India, struggles with fragmented and unreliable sales reporting. By centralizing data through **MySQL** and visualizing key insights in **Power BI**, the project aims to empower the Sales Director with timely, actionable insights for strategic decision-making.


## ❗ Problem Statement

Atliq Hardware faces several challenges in managing its sales reporting:

- No centralized or real-time reporting system to track sales performance  
- Heavy dependence on regional managers’ verbal updates and multiple Excel files  
- Difficulty in identifying sales trends, regional strengths/weaknesses, and product line issues  
- Maintenance of over **69+ Excel files** resulting in tedious, error-prone consolidation
